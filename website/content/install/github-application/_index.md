The easiest way to use Prettifier is to use the existing
[GitHub Application](https://github.com/apps/prettifier). It is free for public
and private repositories.

- go to https://github.com/apps/prettifier
- click on `Configure`
- choose an organization for which you want to install Prettifier
- choose the repositories to add Prettifier to, or select `All repositories`

{{% notice note %}} Prettifier is an application under ongoing development. It
might ask you for new permissions once in a while. It is recommended to accept
them, otherwise Prettifier might not work well for you. {{% /notice %}}
