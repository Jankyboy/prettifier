Consider
[squash-merging](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits)
your pull requests. Doing so keeps Prettifier's fixes but eliminates the commits
it made into your feature branches. It also gets rid of other cruft and detours
that happened during development and are no longer relevant after the feature is
shipped.
