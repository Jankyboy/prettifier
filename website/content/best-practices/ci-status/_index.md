Your CI server should enforce correct formatting. If you run the formatting
checks as a
[separate status check](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-required-status-checks),
contributors get feedback that the problem is not not with their changes but
their formatting, and can pinpoint the issue quickly.
