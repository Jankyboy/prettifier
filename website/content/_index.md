Prettifier is a GitHub bot that keeps your codebase consistently formatted.

{{% notice note %}} Prettier released version 2.0 with
[larger changes to the way it formats](https://prettier.io/blog/2020/03/21/2.0.0.html).
Prettifier runs Prettier for you and adopts these breaking changes. We encourage
you to do so as well. Please adjust the
[Prettier configuration file](https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html) in your
code base to fine-tune how Prettifier formats your changes. {{% /notice %}}
