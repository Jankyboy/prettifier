# Development Tools

This directory contains development tools that ensure consistency of the content in the entire monorepo:

- code formatters
- documentation tools
- spell checkers

**Note:** tools that are specific to a particular code base (compilers, linters, etc) go into their respective code
base. Code bases should have the freedom to use their own development tools.
